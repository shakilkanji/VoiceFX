# VoiceFX
Add sound effects to your voice memos!

I began this project to get a deeper understanding of the AVFoundation Framework.

Key Takeaways:
- a great example of the MVC principles
- learned how to pass files from one view controller to the next
- used Delegation to allow a view controller to take advantage of AVAudioRecorder methods
- created sound effects using AVAudioEngine, an audio graph system new to iOS 8
